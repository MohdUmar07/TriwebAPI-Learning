# CSS 

Welcome to the CSS directory. In this directory, you'll find CSS stylesheets that enhance the appearance and interactivity of HTML projects.

## About

In this directory, I have combined CSS styling with HTML projects to develop visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. Each project's CSS file complements its HTML counterpart, illustrating how CSS can enhance simple web pages and turn them into engaging and beautifully designed experiences.
