# HTML

Welcome to the HTML directory. In this directory, you'll find HTML projects that serve as the foundational structure for web applications.

## About

In this directory, I have created HTML projects to build the structure and content of web pages. Each project demonstrates how HTML can be used to create the skeleton of web applications, which can then be enhanced with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

## HTML Projects

1. [Form](https://github.com/MohdUmar07/TriwebAPI-Learning/tree/main/HTML/Form): Creating a User Registration Form

    This project focuses on building a user registration form using HTML. The form includes fields for user information such as name, email, password, and other relevant details. The HTML structure ensures that the form is organized and easy to navigate for users.
